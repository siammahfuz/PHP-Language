PHP-Language
Welcome to the PHP Programming Language repository!

PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used, open-source, general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development. It powers millions of websites, including popular platforms like WordPress, Facebook, and Wikipedia. PHP is designed to create dynamic and interactive websites and is a crucial language for backend development.

This repository is dedicated to learning PHP, from basic syntax to advanced concepts, and exploring its applications in web development.
